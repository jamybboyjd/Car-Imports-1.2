Esx_carimports.

I made this script some time ago and removed it due to people having problems with the SQL. i have now fixed this after some time away.

Also please note this is a edit of ESX_truckshop. https://github.com/HumanTree92/esx_truckshop

So this is a car import script made to add more options to RP servers now i made this so people could add aftermarket cars and over seas cars to it like JDM ect and more into there server and make it more real.

Now i have added 2 cars into the SQL these are base cars and need changing for you. i will leave a video how to do this.

This script is a whole new dealership and wont mess with another ones you have

Please let me know if you have any problems.

Also the server name is a none working server

I also make maps and scripts live on twitch. https://www.twitch.tv/devingthat
